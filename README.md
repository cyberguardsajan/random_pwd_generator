# Random Password Generator

## About the Project
This is my first Python project aimed at generating random passwords. As I am currently learning Python, I'm also exploring Git and GitHub to improve my technical skills. This script generates a random password with customizable options for the character set, including lowercase letters, uppercase letters, digits, and punctuation.

## Features
The script allows to include any combination of the following character types in your password:
1. Lowercase letters
2. Uppercase letters
3. Digits
4. Punctuation

## Clone the Repository
To clone this repository to your local machine, use the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/password-generator.git
